      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Baseball</h1>
      <p>I have played baseball since I was 8 years old. It all started because my oldest brothers would have wiffle ball tournaments in our backyard with everyone around the neighborhood. I would be the youngest kid out there hitting homeruns on top of our neighbors houses and then I would have to jump the fence and go get it. As I got older, I played on multiple travel teams until I reached high school where I then played all 4 years. My main position was a starting pitcher, but I also liked to play first and third base. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Bowling</h1>
      <p>Bowling has been a family tradition long before I was born. My dad has been bowling for the last 25 years and has passed the love of the sport to me. I joined my first bowling league when I was around 8 years old and bowled every year until high school, where I then focused all my attention on baseball. After I graduated from high school, I got back into bowling and joined a league with my dad and brothers where I still bowl now.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Basketball</h1>
      <p>Basketball has grown to become one of my favorite sports because it is a fun way to do some cardio and a great stress relief. I am currently the captain of a menâ€™s basketball league at my church in Naperville and I also love to play basketball at the gym with friends. I started playing basketball when I was a little kid at the YMCA and eventually phased out of it. As I have gotten older, I have grown to love the sport again.</p>
