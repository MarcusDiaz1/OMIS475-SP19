<header><h2>Play basketball at the gym</h2></header>
    <p>I love to play basketball in my free time at the local gym. I live about 10 minutes away from the Vaughn Center, which is the community center for Aurora residents. I like to play basketball because it is a good workout and its a fun way to compeat with other people. I also have a lot of friends that go to that gym as well, so we all get together and play some competitive basketball games. </p>
