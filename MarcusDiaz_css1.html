<!-- Question2 -->
<h1 style="background-color: black; color: red;"> Chicago Bulls</h1>
<!-- Question1 -->
<p style="background-color:green;color:white;"> The Chicago Bulls have turned into the laughing stock of the NBA. The infamous Chicago Bulls brand, that has been made popular by the greatest basketball player of all time Michael Jordan, has taken a hit in the recent years. The inconsistent upper management and lack of trust in the organization has driven the bulls into a catapult and has made it nearly impossible to be a fan. This needs to stop. Until Chicago finds a new owner, be prepared to be let down by the Bulls for years to come. </p>
